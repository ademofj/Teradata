1. export views to file
2. load file into table view_data_sky
3. list missing header view
   create table view_missing_header as 
    (select xv_name from ( select ......)
     ) with data;
4. list missing locking view
   create table view_used_table as
    (select xv_name,table_name from ( select .....)
    ) with data;

   create table view_locking_table as
    (select xv_name,table_name from ( select .....)
    ) with data;
     
   create table view_missing_locking as
    (select xv_name,table_name 
      from view_used_table 
      where (xv_name,table_name) is not in 
       (select xv_name,table_name 
        from view_locking_table)    
    ) with data;  

   create table view_unused_table as
    (select xv_name,table_name 
      from view_locking_table 
      where (xv_name,table_name) is not in 
       (select xv_name,table_name 
        from view_used_table)    
    ) with data; 
 
5. list missing klook_union_id 
   create table view_missing_klook_union_id as
    (select a.xv_name 
     from 
      ( 
       (select vx_name from view_data_sky 
         where view_text like '%klook_unoin_id%'  
        ) a
       join 
       (select vx_name from view_data_sky 
        where view_text like '%klook_unoin_id%'  
        ) b
        on a.xv_name = b.xv_name
         where b.xv_name is null
       )
      ) with data;   
6. Generate new view for missing header
   create table view_data_sky_new as 
  (
   sel ......
   ) with data;
7. Generate new view for missing locking 

   remove unused table/view in locking list
   create table view_data_sky_new as 
  (
   sel* from view_data_sky a
   where a.view_text like '%locking%' 
      and  a.view_text not in any like 
       ( select '%' ||b.table_name||'%' 
         from view_unused_table b
         where a.xv_name = b.xv_name 
         ) 
   ) with data;
  
  create table view_data_sky_new as 
  (
   sel ......
   ) with data;
 
8. Handle klook_unoin_id
a. no union key word
  create table view_missing_klook_union_id_simple
  as (
      select a.xv_name 
      from view_missing_klook_union_id  aa  
     jion 
     (select a.xv_name 
       from view_data_sky a
       join view_missing_klook_union_id b
       on a.xv_name = b.xv_name
       where view_text like '%union%'
       group by 1
      ) bb
      on aa.xv_name= bb.xv_name
      ) with data;

b. union all key word
  create table view_missing_klook_union_id_middle
  as (
       select a.xv_name 
       from view_data_sky a
       join view_missing_klook_union_id b
       on a.xv_name = b.xv_name
       where view_text like '%union all%'
       group by 1
      ) with data; 

c .compect
  select xv_name from view_missing_klook_union_id 
  minus
  select xv_name from view_missing_klook_union_simple
  minus
  select xv_name from view_missing_klook_union_middle
 
d. get sn for As, Select, From and union 
......
a1.gen rank_id,
a2.select rank_id for sn-1  for From
a3.select rank_id for sn-1 for AS
